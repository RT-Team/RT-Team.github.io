# What is a Self Bot (Self Bot)?
A self bot is not a bot account, but a normal account (the one you are using on Discord) that is automatically running like a bot.  
Discord has an API that is used to run bots, but it is being abused by normal user accounts.  
Self-botting is now against the terms of service and should not be done.
## What about it?
Unlike bot accounts, user accounts can use their own invitation link to enter the server.  
This means that a group of people can come into the server out of the blue and troll the server by spamming and mentioning a large number of people.  
Recently, there has been an increase in the use of self-botting programs to spam the server.  
The worst that can happen is that the server will be down for a while, or there will be too many of them for the ban to catch up.  
In addition, even after the server has been vandalized, it is very difficult to ban the group.
## How to deal with it
Implement RT verification.  
This is a feature that allows you to speak after checking if you are human.  
This will prevent most of them.  
The trolls will have to log in to a large number of abandoned sites one by one to check if they are human or not.  
This is very difficult and tedious, and most people give up.  
Therefore, it is better to implement RT authentication or other bot authentication functions.  
RT, in particular, has image and web authentication, and some of its features use a very popular anti-self-bot program.  
In addition, the functions are constantly updated and highly secure, so I highly recommend using them.
## Finally
Self-botting can be dangerous, but you can prevent it by using RT. Go to the [RT homepage](https://rt-bot.com/) and install RT!
