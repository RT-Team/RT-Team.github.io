# Tutorial
This is something you should read if you are new to RT.  
If there is anything in here that you feel you don't need to do, you can skip it.  
And I think you'll see the word "role" in here.  
If you don't know what a role is, do a Google search for `Discord roles`.

## Kick unwanted bots
RT has a lot of general bot features such as roles, polls, recruitment, ticket panel, and channel status.  
So, there may be some bots that you don't want by adding RT.  
Using RT in place of these bots will reduce the number of bots.
### Examples of replaceable bots
The following is a list of common and standard Bot functions in particular.

* Bot used for the role panel.
* Bot used for voting panel
* Bot used for the recruitment panel
* Bot used for channel status
* Bot used for welcome message
* Bot used for welcome message

Also, RT has a music player and readout, so you may not need a music player or readout either.  
By the way, there is also [ritsu-tan](/rt-chan), which is a sub of RT that can only use the music player and readout.  
RT is a really multifunctional bot, so check the help pages carefully, because you may end up adding other bots to RT that are actually there.  
If there are any other Bot features that you would like to see in RT, please contact the [Support Server](https://discord.gg/ugMGw5w) and let us know.

Now let's move to RT.

## How to get help
Please see [here](/en/notes/help).  
If you don't know how to read the help, you may not be able to use the functions properly.  
Make sure you understand it.

## Check permissions
There are many functions in RT that require a lot of permissions.  
It is recommended that you have administrator privileges.

## Authentication settings
You can set up image, web, and password authentication to prevent vandalism.
## Why?
There is an increase in the number of Discord discards that are being spammed automatically by programs.  
Authentication can be used to prevent this from happening.  
By using authentication, you can make sure that each member who joins is a human being, and only give them a role that allows them to speak if they are confirmed to be human.  
By using this, trolls need to log in to a discarded account and authenticate themselves.  
Authentication is difficult because abandoned accounts are sometimes bought and sold.  
Web authentication will be especially strong.
### How to do.
You can check from [here](https://rt-bot.com/help.html?g=server-safety&c=captcha).

## Set up anti-spam.
You can use RT to mute/ban spammers when you find them.  
Take a good look at [here](https://rt-bot.com/help.html?g=server-safety&c=automod).

## The End
You may think it's too soon to finish, but if you know how to read the help, you can use RT just by looking at the help.  
And if it doesn't work or you don't understand it, go to the support server.  
(Go to [RT's website](https://rt-bot.com) and click on the support server link.)  
Let's have a fun life of bot and server administration.
