# Slash command categories
In order to register all commands, RT's slash commands are divided by the category in the help for that command.  
For example, `rt!tts join` for starting TTS in the entertainment category is `/entertainment tts join`.

## Run from slash what is not in slash
It is possible to execute commands not registered in the slash from the slash.  
(I don't think you'll normally use this, though.)  
This is possible with the `/rt run command`.  
Example: `/rt run ping` (This is equivalent to `rt!ping`.)
