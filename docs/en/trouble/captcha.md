# Troubleshooting RT Captcha
See this if you have a trouble in captcha.

## The captcha doesn't work?
First, look at RT's status. If RT is offline or the status is '起動準備中...', you can't use the captcha.

### When RT says "You are not target of authentication" in one-click captcha
Has it been passed more than 1 hour since the people that want to authentication joined?  
By default, RT ignores your authentication if you joined more than 1 hour ago.  
In that case, try to leave the server and join the server again.  
But still RT says "You are not...", please come to RT official server.
